# Tracing Middleware

The tracing middleware provides a way to trace the execution of a request through the application. It is based on the [OpenTelemetry](http://opentelemetry.io/) standard and can be used with any tracer that implements this standard.

The package is forked from [tracing](https://github.com/go-kratos/kratos/tree/8b8dc4b0f8bebb76939780f59734c20c265669c5/middleware/tracing) and optimized on this basis. Thanks to the original author for his contribution.

## Usage Example

```go
// todo
```
